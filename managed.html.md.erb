title: How to integrate your managed services

Here is how to integrate your [brokered service](./brokered.html) more closely with <%= vars.platform_name %> to create a managed service and service tile for VMware Tanzu.

## <a id="overview"></a> Managed services overview

The next level of integration is to get your service to be deployed on <%= vars.platform_name %> rather
than externally, on the same IaaS that your particular Cloud Foundry instance
is deployed on, and by the same orchestration tool, [BOSH](http://bosh.io).

This is usually one of the more involved integrations, as you configure your packaging to allow your service components to be deployed by [BOSH](http://bosh.io) onto the <%= vars.platform_name %> infrastructure.

Offering your software as a managed service means that your <%= vars.platform_name %> customers
can not have to learn different ways to deploy, manage, and monitor
different components of their application platform.

As with the brokered service, the service has a service broker and a tile listed on VMware Tanzu Network. VMware Tanzu Network lists managed services as "for VMware Tanzu," without "Service Broker" in the name.

To integrate your service at this level, you configure to learn about stemcells, BOSH releases, and manifests. You can decide how your service maps to virtual machines and how persistent storage is managed.

### <a id="managed-mvp"></a> Minimal viable product

Minimal Viable Product (MVP) version of a managed service be a single, shared service instance, and don't yet
worry too much about High Availability of this instance. This integration level is mostly about getting the BOSH packaging, deployment, and monitoring working
correctly.

### <a id="managed-ha"></a> High availability

After you have a managed service, you can decide to prioritize either
[on-demand provisioning](./on-demand.html) of service instances, or making your
single shared service instance more highly available.

When properly configured, BOSH monitors and restarts any failing processes
and virtual machines that are part of your service deployment. To further increase availability, consider spreading your
resources across multiple availability zones or even regions, and replicating
your persistent storage across those as well.

## <a id="create"></a> Create a managed service

* For BOSH to manage your service, you must create a BOSH release for it.
[BOSH releases](./bosh-release.html) explains how to do this, and how to use your already-existing Docker image as a shortcut.

* After you created a BOSH release for your managed service integration, you can work through [Building your first tile](./index.html#tile-steps) to create your tile.

* The [Tile generator](./tile-generator.html) tool automatically creates the life cycle errands that can run after a <%= vars.platform_name %> tile is deployed or before it is removed. Operators control which errands run the next time they click **Apply Changes** to redeploy. See the [Errands](./tile-errands.html) topic for how <%= vars.platform_name %> operators control when errands run, and how to set default errand run rules in the tile.

At any level of integration, use [Concourse](./concourse.html) for continuous integration during development.
